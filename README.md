# DNA and Gene Sequence Practical - Guess Who!
Mini practical session for 11-16 year olds about how we learn about the DNA sequence of genes. Estimated time: 15 minutes, expandable to 1 hour.

<h3>Objectives</h3>
* Learn about how DNA is made up of 4 different bases and different sections make up <b>Genes</b>
* Learn how different versions of genes control how people/animals/plants look and work
* Learn how we can sequence and read DNA to find out what our Guess Who subject looks like!

<h3>Resources and setup</h3>
* 4 colours of ball-pit balls (approximately 5 of each).
* Staging area for 9 balls (perhaps cut into 3x3 for explaining codons)
* Computer/laptop for searching the sequence against database (Raspberri Pi is perfect, Mac works too, PCs need more setup)
* Print, laminate and cut out Gene cards and face parts (for human Guess Who)

An alternative is to have the kids draw faces themselves and compare at the end, or be a better artist than me and create them yourself!

<h3>Computer Setup</h3>
* Copy the DNA-searcher.pl program onto your computer and run it. (It helps to zoom the screen in).
* If you are not used to running command line programs follow these steps:
- Save the program to your home directory.
- Open the _terminal_ program.
- Type `ls`. You should see the `./DNA-searcher.pl` listed there. If it is not there, type `pwd` and move the program to the location that it shows you.
- Type `perl DNA-searcher.pl`
* DONE!
* There is a short PDF file (DNA_Guess_who.pdf) which explains what DNA, genes and the 4 bases are, and the aim of the session. You may want to copy that over if you think it would be useful.

<h3>Running the session</h3>
After a brief intro, the session follows these stages. Usually I assign one kid to each stage and then rotate roles but alternatively each child could do the full run with their gene:
* Select one varient/allele/type of gene from each 'genepool'.
* Generate the DNA sequence of your gene with the coloured balls on the stand ('zooming in on the gene')
* Using the 'laser-decoder', translate the coloured balls into DNA bases (saying it out loud)
* Type the sequence into the computer program as the decoder reads it out
* Search the sequence and add to the diagram that is forming!
